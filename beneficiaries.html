      <div class="hosen plr80 pb30">Many LGBT+ students are at risk for homelessness and bullying. About 40% of homeless youth are LGBT+ even though they only make up about 10% of the overall youth population. The charities we've chosen to benefit  in the NC Rainbow Run address these problems in different ways. The Open House is located in Wilmington, NC and is an emergency shelter for youths who are homeless, abused, neglected, or have run away. They provide support, counselling, food, clothing, and shelter to ensure the safety of homeless teens. <a href=" http://www.coastalhorizons.org/services/crisis_intervention/index.php#oh" target="_blank">Their website can be found here.</a>
    </div>
    
    <div class="hosen plr80 pb30">The money from the registration fees will only go to the Open House but you can also raise funds for other charities to compete for the fundraising prizes. One such charity is the Ali Forney Center which is the largest organization for homeless LGBT+ youth. They offer emergency housing and transitional housing. They also offer street outreach, case management, primary medical care, HIV/AIDS testing, counselling, showers and food, an employment assistance plan, and referral to housing and psychiatry programs. <a href="http://www.aliforneycenter.org/index.cfm?" target="_blank">Their website is here.</a>
    </div>
      
      
    
    <div class="hosen plr80 pb50 pb30">Another charity you can raise money for independently for our fundraising prize is the <a href="http://www.pointfoundation.org" target="_blank">Point Foundation</a>; giving scholarships to LGBT+ people everywhere so they can succeed despite the obstacles put in front of them. You could also fundraise for the <a href="http://jimcollinsfoundation.org" target="_blank">Jim Collin's Foundation</a> which is an organization that provides people with money for a sex change if they cannot afford one. You also have the option to fundraise the <a href="http://www.astraeafoundation.org/fuelingthefrontlines/" target="_blank">Astrea Lesbian Foundation;</a> on the frontlines fighting classism, racism, and homophobia in 35 countries.</div>
