<p>The NC Rainbow Run is an untimed 5K trail race taking place on Saturday, March 5th at <a href="http://oldriverfarmsnc.com" target="_blank">Old River Farms</a>  in Burgaw, North Carolina. The run is organized by two high school students with help from volunteers from the Hoggard High School GSA (Gay-Straight Alliance). All registration proceeds will benefit the Open House, a center for homeless LGBT+ teens in Wilmington, NC. The difference between our race and others is that ours is not about speed--it's about raising funds! Awards will be given for individuals and teams raising the most for the organizations that help LGBT+ youth.
