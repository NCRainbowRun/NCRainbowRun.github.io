<p>Event  Description</p>

<p>The NC Rainbow Run is an untimed 5K trail race taking place on Saturday, March 7th at Old River Farms (x) in Burgaw, North Carolina. The run is organized by two high school students with help from volunteers from the Hoggard High School GSA (Gay-Straight Alliance). All registration proceeds will benefit the Open House, a center for homeless LGBT+ teens in Wilmington, NC. The difference between our race and others is that ours is not about speed--it's about raising funds! Awards will be given for individuals and teams raising the most for the organizations that help LGBT+ youth.
